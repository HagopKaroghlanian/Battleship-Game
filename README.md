# Battleship-game
A Battleship game where the player attempts to sink all three battleships.
As a player, you can enter your choice in the form at the bottom right of the page. The program will keep track of your guesses and visually show them on the board as a Miss or Hit. You can also visually see if you hit a ship or missed in writing at the top left side of the page. Once you sink all three ships, you will get a message saying you sank all my battleships.
